# hadoop-projects
# This repository contains my learnings about Hadoop.


Installation:
Laptop : Macbook
cmd: brew install hadoop

open the hadoop folder "cd /opt/homebrew/Cellar/hadoop/3.4.0/libexec/etc/hadoop" in terminal for further making changes for config files

I am using visual studio code(vsc) cmd: code . which is handy to open entire folder in vsc

check if the following files are available 
core-site.xml
hdfs-site.xml
mapred-site.xml
yarn-site.xml
hadoop-env.sh
